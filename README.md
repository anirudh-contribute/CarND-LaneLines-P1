Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go. The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

In this project I detected lane lines in images using Python and OpenCV.  OpenCV means "Open-Source Computer Vision", which is a package that has many useful tools for analyzing images.  

To complete the project, two files were submitted: a file containing [project code](TibrewalAnirudh_project_lanes.ipynb) and a file containing a brief [write up](writeup_AnirudhTibrewal.pdf) explaining my solution.

To meet specifications in the project, specifications from the [project rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/322/view) were fulfilled

The output videos I obtained from the project are also available in the repository at (/test_videos_output/)
